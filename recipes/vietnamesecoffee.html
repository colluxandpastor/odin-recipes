    <p>Learn how to make Vietnamese coffee (cà phê sữa nóng), a sweet, rich coffee drink involving sweetened condensed milk and strong drip coffee.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons Vietnamese ground coffee, such as Trung Nguyen brand, or a quality French roast</li>
        <li>1-3 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk, to taste</li>
        <li>6-8 ounces water, near boiling, the lesser amount will make stronger coffee and the greater weaker coffee</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Vietnamese phin coffee filter, add the ground coffee to the filter or the beaker of a french press, taking care not to shake the filter or tamp the coffee grounds.</li>
        <li>Pour the desired amount of condensed milk into a heat-proof glass or mug.</li>
        <li>Place phin over the drinking vessel, if using phin.</li>
        <li>Measure out the desired amount of near boiling water.</li>
        <li>Pour approximately one ounce of the water over the coffee grounds, to "bloom" them.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the water to grounds, using the phin's press to lightly tamp the grounds, or if brewing in a french press, stirring for 30 seconds.</li> 
        <li>Wait for coffee to stop passing through the phin, or wait 5 minutes for coffee to steep in the french press, and then pour into your drinking vessel.</li>
        <li>Stir condensed milk into coffee, and drink while hot, or add ice.</li> 
    </ol>
